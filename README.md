# Fuzzy Optimization-OR-Solutions

Welcome to the *Fuzzy-Optimization-OR-Solutions* repository. This repository hosts presentations that provide an overview of three advanced projects in the field of fuzzy optimization and operations research. Each project explores complex problems and their solutions using fuzzy logic to enhance decision-making and problem-solving in various operations research scenarios.

### Repository Content:
This section contains three PowerPoint presentations (PDF format), each offering a concise summary of the respective project:

- **Optimizing Queue Process with a Fuzzy Jackson Network**
  - This presentation outlines the development and analysis of a fuzzy Jackson network for modeling online queue processes. It highlights the methods used and key findings from the project.
- **Solving the Fuzzy Shortest Path Problem with Special Fuzzy Numbers**
  - A summary of the approach to solving fuzzy network flow problems using octagonal, hexagonal, trapezoidal, and triangular fuzzy numbers. It includes an overview of the methodology and numerical illustrations validating the solutions.
- **Fuzzy Optimization in Transportation, Assignment, and Travelling Salesman Problems**
  - This presentation explores the application of fuzzy theory to classic optimization challenges, including transportation, assignment, and travelling salesman problems, with a focus on obtaining optimal solutions through fuzzy methods.

#### Note:
The detailed reports for these projects are comprehensive and extensive, making them unsuitable for direct upload to this repository. Instead, these presentations provide a clear, summarized view of the key aspects and findings of each project, making the content more accessible and easier to understand.
